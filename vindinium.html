<h2> What Is The Vindinium, How Does It Work, And What's Up With The Mines And Taverns? </h2>
<p> Vindinium is a game where players must write code for their individual bot. This bot is placed in a 
Hunger Games style environment where they fight fellow bots and struggle over Taverns, in which additional lives
may be found, and mines. The object of the game is to collect the most mines and survive even as your friend bots fall. 
</p>
<h2> How My Code Works </h2>
<p> I set my bot to do 3 things; the first of which is finding taverns. When a bot reaches a tavern, it gains a life. Therefore, it
is essential that a bot know when and how to find said tavern. You do this through two blocks of code. The first defines what. The 
second defines how. In my first block of code, I created an if statement that said if the bot has less than 10 lives it should run 
the function "Find Nearest Tavern". The second block says  what this function is, and quickly calculates the distance each tavern 
is from my bot and compares it with all others to find the nearest. It then tells the bot to go in that direction.</p>
<p> The second thing my bot does is attacking enemies when they are near it and it has enough lives. This code has two blocks as well. 
First, I do an if statement, like the previous. The second block defines the function, and uses the same process to find the nearest bot.</p>
<p> Lastly, my bot uses the attack function in another way, when an enemy bot with less lives is close to them. I use an if statement yet again.
I do not need to have a second block since the attack function was already defined.
</p>

<h2> So What Did I Learn About AI? </h2>
<p> AI requires two things: a what and a how. If you have those two things, your bot can do anything you want. There is one other thing to note: 
else statements. A bot usually runs through a series of if statements to figure out what the most strategic next move would be. 
This makes it so you must have a fall-back plan, or an else statement that leads the bot back to the most rewarding and easiest task: 
finding mines. During the first runs of my bot, I noticed it sporadically went suicidal and lost many of its lives. Figuring that this was
a bot and not a creature tired of watching its friend bots die before its eyes, I realized it was something in the code. My bot did not fit into any of the 
if statements, and so it ended up dying whilst needlessly attacking. To fix this, I added an else statement that said to free mines. AI is simple
as long as you know how to do if statements. My opinion has changed because never before have I noticed the importance of the humble if statement.</p>
