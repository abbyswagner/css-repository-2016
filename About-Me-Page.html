        <h2> A Humble Introduction</h2>
    <p style="display:inline-block; width: 70%; text-align: left"> Salutations! My name is Abby Wagner, and I am a tenth grade student at Summit Shasta High School in Daly City, California. Being a fifteen year-old living so close to San Francisco, there is so much to do, whether it be riding the cable cars, hanging
        by the ocean, or just reading some random About Me page on the internet. In the following sections, you will get to find out more about my life and interests; therefore, if you would like to spend, or waste depending on how valuable this information
        is, some time reading a little bit more about me, go right ahead.
    </p>

<p style="display:inline-block;width:60%; float: right;"> One extracurricular that I spend a majority of my time doing is martial arts. Over the past seven years, I have learned four different types of karate: kajukenbo, shintaikido, krav maga, and mixed martial arts. One of my biggest achievements, in fact, was gaining my first black belt at end of eighth grade. I first started karate in 3rd grade, part because of the insistence of my parents and part because of my somewhat unhealthy obsession with different action movies. When I first started, karate, I was a bit caught off guard by the many differences between real martial arts and that of the movies. I was half expecting to learn how to chop boards in half; however, I soon realized that this was not so. I guess the reason I stayed in karate, and continue to enjoy it to this day, is how much it involves strategy and skill. Karate is a sport centered on knowledge of your own limits and strengths and those of your partner. </p>
