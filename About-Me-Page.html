        <h2 style="text-align: center"> A Humble Introduction</h2>
            

    <p style="margin-right: 306px"> Salutations! My name is Abby Wagner, and I am a tenth grade student at Summit Shasta High School in Daly City, California. Being a fifteen year-old living so close to San Francisco, there is so much to do, whether it be riding the cable cars, hanging
        by the ocean, or just reading some random About Me page on the internet. In the following sections, you will get to find out more about my life and interests; therefore, if you would like to spend, or waste depending on how valuable this information
        is, some time reading a little bit more about me, go right ahead.
    </p>




<h2 style="text-align: center"> Violence </h2>
<img src="https://www.askideas.com/media/13/Funny-Boy-Karate-Gif.gif" alt="heck yeah" style="float:left;">
<p style="margin-left:320px;"> One extracurricular that I spend a majority of my time doing is martial arts. Over the past seven years, I have learned four different types of karate: kajukenbo, shintaikido, krav maga, and mixed martial arts. One of my biggest achievements, in fact, was gaining my first black belt at the end of eighth grade. I first started karate in 3rd grade, part because of the insistence of my parents and part because of my somewhat unhealthy obsession with different action movies. When I first started karate, I was a bit caught off guard by the many differences between real martial arts and that of the movies. I was half expecting to learn how to chop boards in half; however, I soon realized that this was not so. I guess the reason I stayed in karate, and continue to enjoy it to this day, is how much it involves strategy and skill. Karate is a sport centered on knowledge of your own limits and strengths and those of your partner. </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center"> The Majestic Oboe </h2>
<img src="http://www.wonderfulwinds.com/userimages/oboes.png" style="width:250px; float: right; margin-right: -15px">
<p style="margin-right: 256px;"> Through the years, I have also picked up a love for music. The way instruments have interacted with each other to form whole symphonies has always fascinated me, especially one instrument in particular: the humble oboe. The oboe is a woodwind commonly mistaken for either a bassoon or a clarinet, and is, my opinion, the most important instrument in the band. Of course, this belief has nothing to do with the fact that I have played this majestic instrument since middle school. If you have ever heard the finale in the famous ballet, the Swan Lake, the oboe plays the opening, most famous part. I enjoy playing this instrument because of the beautiful duck like sounds it makes that will immediately steal your heart. </p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center"> Reading </h2>
    <p style: "margin-right: 250px">  I have always adored the magical worlds found in books, from the corridors of Hogwarts to the training grounds in Camp Halfblood. I grew up with characters such as Severus Snape and Nancy Drew that brought me to places only of dreams. I do not know the person I would be without seeing the courage and cleverness of so many book heroes. Fantasy brings us to a place that much closer to the future, and that is why I love it.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center; "> Disney </h2>
<p style="margin-left: 450px; margin-right: 320px"> Probably proving further my immaturity, I am obsessed with Disney movies. From High School Musical, of which I have memorized all the songs, to the Aristocats, which still makes me laugh uncontrollably, I have studied these movies like a textbook. I love Disney because of its creativity and universal appeal.</p>
