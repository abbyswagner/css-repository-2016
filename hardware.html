    <h1> Hardware </h1>
    <p style="text-align: center"> Look at the sections below to learn about the parts that make up the mystifying machine that is the computer.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 50px"> The Mighty Monitor </h2>
    <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jZu8IN%2BYL._SL1500_.jpg" style="width: 300px;">
    <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px"> First, the computer monitor. Odds are that right now you are looking into your own computer monitor right now in order to see this webpage. The monitor is the screen attached to your paragraph that shows different text and graphics. It’s like a portal into your computer. The things you see on your monitor are created by the different programs on your computer to show what is going on.
</p>
    </div>
    
    <div style= "float: left; width: 40%; margin-left: 100px">
    <h2> The Kindly Keyboard </h2>
    <img src="http://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-blhknq8/product_images/uploaded_images/acer-aspire-e15-keyboard-key-replacement.png?t=1425361917" style="width: 300px">
    <p> To get to this webpage, you might have typed in a link or even clicked the Hardware Page on the navigation bar. Either way, you used your keyboard to tell your computer to come to this page. The keyboard is an input device. It tells the computer what you want it to do through a series of buttons.
</p>

    </div>
    <div style= "float: right; width: 40%; margin-right: 100px">
    <h2> The Magestic Mouse </h2>
    <img src="https://brocku.ca/brock-news/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/computer-mouse-banner.jpg" style="width: 200px">
    <p> In order to scroll through this webpage, you moved a small clicker type display across the page by using your finger to move left and right; this is the mouse. Mice are ways for the user to navigate through the crowded world of the computer.  It’s another way for the user to sort through the computer's data. </p>
    </div>
    <div style="float: left; width: 40%; margin-left: 100px">
        <h2> Very Important Video Card</h2>
        <img src="http://notgamejay.neocities.org/GraphicsCard1.png" style="width: 300px">
        <p> The video card generates the images you see on your monitor, like the web page. It creates output images and text that the user can see. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div style= "float:right; width: 40%; margin-right: 100px">
        <h2 > The Saintly Sound Card </h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Turtle_Beach_Sound_Card_(Catalina).png" style="width: 300px;">
        <p> Plugged into the motherboard are cards that produce sounds. If you were to watch a video right now, without headphones, the sounds being made would be from the sound cards. Sound cards are a part in every computer so that the user can hear different programs. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div style="margin-top: 700px; text-align: center">
        <h2> The Salty CPU (or Central Processing Unit) </h2>
        <img src="http://www.eurotech.com/images/products/CPU-1233/CPU-1233.jpg" style="width: 300px">
        <p> The CPU runs and reads programs. Most actions done by the computer are acted out by the CPU. For example, when you run a program, it is the CPU that reads the orders you give the computer and turns it into actions. </p>
    </div>
    <div style="width: 40%; float: left; margin-left: 100px">
        <h2> The Rambunctious RAM </h2>
        <img src="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_133277192.jpg" style="width: 300px">
        <p> The RAM is the short term memory. The pros of RAM are that it is very fast and easy to save. However, it takes an enormous amount of power to keep data on the RAM. For this reason, RAMs are usually connected to an outside power source. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div style="float: right; width: 40%; margin-right: 100px">
        <h2> The Hardy Hard Drive </h2>
        <img src="http://usa-digital.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ihs-isuppli-thailand-floods-hard-drives.jpg" style="width: 300px">
        <p> The hard drive is a storage spot for the computer's data. It takes long term data, so things like how to reboot or how to use a search engine are wired into metallic plates that are electromagnetically charged. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 500px">
        <h2> The Mammoth Motherboard </h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/MicroATX_Motherboard_with_AMD_Athlon_Processor_2_Digon3.jpg" style="width: 400px">
        <p> The motherboard is a large card to which most other pieces of the computer are connected. The motherboard manages communication between all the systems. For example, it manages power for all subsystems, so when one is low on power, it can easily be recharged.
