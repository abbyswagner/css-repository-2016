    <p style="text-align: center"> Look at the sections below to learn about the parts that make up the mystifying machine that is the computer.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 50px"> The Mighty Monitor </h2>
    <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jZu8IN%2BYL._SL1500_.jpg" style="width: 300px;">
    <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px"> First, the computer monitor. Odds are that right now you are looking into your own computer monitor right now in order to see this webpage. The monitor is the screen attached to your paragraph that shows different text and graphics. It’s like a portal into your computer. The things you see on your monitor are created by the different programs on your computer to show what is going on. It helps the user navigate throught the extensive information stored in the computer. In the distant past, monitors were comprised of a multitude of light bulbs that lit up when different information was processed. Today, the computer monitor uses elements of similar television screens so that we can see more visually pleasing representations of such computer information. The monitor is an integral part of the computer, and the one most seen by the common man.

    <h2> The Kindly Keyboard </h2>

    <p> To get to this webpage, you might have typed in a link or even clicked the Hardware Page on the navigation bar. Either way, you used your keyboard to tell your computer to come to this page. The keyboard is an input device. It tells the computer what you want it to do through a series of buttons. If you wanted your computer to run a specific program or do a specific task, you use your keyboard to tell your computer this information. The keyboard is based off of the stock ticker machines that were used in the 1870s. It has a set of numbers, letters, and other characters so the user can fully enunciate what they want the computer to do.

    <h2> The Magestic Mouse </h2>
    <img src="https://brocku.ca/brock-news/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/computer-mouse-banner.jpg" style="width: 200px">
    <p> In order to scroll through this webpage, you moved a small clicker type display across the page by using your finger to move left and right; this is the mouse. Mice are ways for the user to navigate through the crowded world of the computer.  It’s another way for the user to sort through the computer's data. The mouse was created in 1941 by an officer in the British Navy who wanted a more sophisticated way to enter data pertaining to target attack. This device was kept a secret until a similar design was patented and sold by a German company in the late 1960s. Now, we use a much more intelligent decendent, one of the most famous parts of the modern computer. </p>

        <h2> Very Important Video Card</h2>
        <img src="http://notgamejay.neocities.org/GraphicsCard1.png" style="width: 300px">
        <p> The video card generates the images you see on your monitor, like the web page. It creates output images and text that the user can see. The first computers did not have video cards as these devices did not display images. Integrated graphics is when a video card is integrated into the motherboard or the CPU. Though integrated graphics often makes for shared resorces between the CPU and video card, it also boasts low cost, simplicity, and low energy use. A dedicated video card has its own RAM, cooling system, and battery usage system so that it can specifically process images. Without it, computers would not be able to display any of the things needed for the user.</p>

        <h2 > The Saintly Sound Card </h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Turtle_Beach_Sound_Card_(Catalina).png" style="width: 300px;">
        <p> Plugged into the motherboard are cards that produce sounds. If you were to watch a video right now, without headphones, the sounds being made would be from the sound cards. Sound cards are a part in every computer so that the user can hear different programs. Brother to the video card, the sound card outputs sounds that the user wants to listen to. It does this usually by using a digital-to-analog- converter, where recoreded digital data is converted into an analog for the computer to read. Sound cards were very uncommon until 1988 when a group of computer game CEOs stated that in order to make PCs the leading computer brand, they needed sounds, normalizing this once odd part of the computer. </p>

        <h2> The Salty CPU (or Central Processing Unit) </h2>
        <img src="http://www.eurotech.com/images/products/CPU-1233/CPU-1233.jpg" style="width: 300px">
        <p> The CPU runs and reads programs. Most actions done by the computer are acted out by the CPU. For example, when you run a program, it is the CPU that reads the orders you give the computer and turns it into actions. The CPU has three main parts that are used in all CPU designs, regardless of the maker: the arithmetic logic unit, which performs calculations; the processor register, which supplies operations and data from the arithmetic logic unit; and the control unit that gets directions from the memory and directs them towards the other parts of the CPU. The first computer was, by definition, a CPU because it could run programs. </p>

        <h2> The Rambunctious RAM </h2>
        <img src="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_133277192.jpg" style="width: 300px">
        <p> The RAM is the short term memory. The pros of RAM are that it is very fast and easy to save. However, it takes an enormous amount of power to keep data on the RAM. For this reason, RAMs are usually connected to an outside power source. RAMs were put on the market in the 1970s. Older computers used delay lines where data could only be read in the order it was written, making for less flexibility. There are two types of RAM today, the dynamic RAM and the static RAM. Static RAMs store data in six transistor memory cells; these RAMs are more expensive, but is faster and uses less power to work. The dynamic RAM uses a transistor and a capacitor duo to work, and is less expenisve and more predominant today. All RAMs are volatile, or they depend on power or else they lose all data.</p>

        <h2> The Hardy Hard Drive </h2>
        <img src="http://usa-digital.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ihs-isuppli-thailand-floods-hard-drives.jpg" style="width: 300px">
        <p> The hard drive is a storage spot for the computer's data. It takes long term data, so things like how to reboot or how to use a search engine are wired into metallic plates that are electromagnetically charged. Hard drives are used by the computers file system and operating system, so most parts cannot be directly changed by the user. Hard drives were first used in 1956, but only by transactioning process computers that were not for the average consumer. With new advancements, they became cheaper and more average by the late 1980s.</p>

        <h2> The Mammoth Motherboard </h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/MicroATX_Motherboard_with_AMD_Athlon_Processor_2_Digon3.jpg" style="width: 400px">
        <p> The motherboard is a large card to which most other pieces of the computer are connected, and is a massive circuit where most parts plug in to. The motherboard manages communication between all the systems. For example, it manages power for all subsystems, so when one is low on power, it can easily be recharged by taking power from a system with surplus. In the past, systems were connected by actual cables, but by the late 1980s and early 1990s, companies found that have a central circuit instead with more communication functions would be economically more beneficial. The motherboard itself does not have any function other than controling the other systems.
